cd\_immune,$\gamma_{immune}$,always,see Section~\ref{sec:medical_params},duration for which individuals stay immune after having contracted Covid-19
cd\_infectious\_true,$\gamma_{infectious}$,always,see Section~\ref{sec:medical_params},time between infection and the onset of infectiousness
cd\_infectious\_false,$\gamma_{stop infectious}$,always,see Section~\ref{sec:medical_params},duration of infectiousness
cd\_symptoms\_true,"$\gamma_{symptoms, a}$",always,see Section~\ref{sec:medical_params},"time (possibly infinite) until the onset of symptoms, for individuals of age group $a$"
cd\_symptoms\_false,$\gamma_{stop symptoms}$,always,see Section~\ref{sec:medical_params},duration of symptoms for symptomatic cases
cd\_needs\_icu\_true,"$\gamma_{icu, a}$",always,see Section~\ref{sec:medical_params},time (possibly infinite) until an individual requires intensive care (given she has developed symptoms). The probability of and duration until requiring intensive care depends on the individual’s age group $a$
cd\_needs\_icu\_false,$\gamma_{stop icu}$,always,see Section~\ref{sec:medical_params},time (possibly infinite) until an individual recovers from requiring intensive care
cd\_dead\_true,"$\gamma_{dead, a}$",always,see Section~\ref{sec:medical_params},time (possibly infinite) until an individual dies in intensive care. The probability of and duration until death depends on the individual’s age group $a$
