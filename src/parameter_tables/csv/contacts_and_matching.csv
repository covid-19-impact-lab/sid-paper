n\_contacts,$\eta_{c}$,always,\cite{Mossong2008},number of contacts in contact type $c$. For non recurrent contacts the number of contacts is drawn every day. For recurrent contacts individuals are assigned group identifiers that determine the groups in which they meet either daily or weekly. The number of groups individuals belong to are calibrated to arrive at the number of recurrent contacts reported in \cite{Mossong2008}.
degree of assortativity,"$\alpha_{c, a_i, a_j, county_i, county_j}$",always,\cite{Mossong2008},"probability in contact type $c$ that an individual of age group $a_i$ and county $county_i$ meets an individual of age group $a_j$ and county $county_j$. Contacts can be assortative by age group, state and county. The degree of assortativity depends on the contact type `c`."
