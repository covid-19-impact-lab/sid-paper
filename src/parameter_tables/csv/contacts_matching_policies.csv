n\_contacts,"$\eta_{c,\:n}$",always,\citet{Mossong2008}, probability to have $n$ contacts in contact type $c$. For non recurrent contacts the number of contacts is drawn for each individual every day. For recurrent contacts individuals are assigned group identifiers that determine the groups in which they meet either daily or weekly. The number of groups individuals belong to are calibrated to arrive at the number of recurrent contacts reported in \citet{Mossong2008}. See Section~\ref{subsec:data_number_of_contacts}.
degree\_of\_assortativity,"$\alpha_{c,\:a_i,\:a_j,\:county_i,\:county_j}$",always,\citet{Mossong2008},"probability in contact type $c$ that an individual of age group $a_i$ and county $county_i$ meets an individual of age group $a_j$ and county $county_j$. Contacts can be assortative by age group, state and county. The degree of assortativity depends on the contact type `c`. See Section~\ref{subsec:assortativity} for details."

work\_attend\_multiplier,"$\rho_{w,\:attend,\:t}$",always,\citet{Google2021},"share of workers that continue to have work contacts, i.e. do not work from home on date $t$. We use the reduction in work mobility reported by \citet{Google2021} as a proxy for the share of workers that work from home. See Section~\ref{subsec:policies} for details."
hygiene\_multiplier,$\rho_{hygiene}$,since November 2020,estimated,reduction in transmission during work and educational contacts due to stricter hygiene measures such as wearing face masks. See Section~\ref{subsec:estimated_params}.
other\_multiplier,"$\rho_{other,\:t}$",always,estimated,"reduction in the transmission during other contacts, such as leisure. This incorporates both hygiene measures as well as the reduction of physical meetings. There are nine breakpoints for the whole estimation period. See Section~\ref{subsec:estimated_params} for details."
