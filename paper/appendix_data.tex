\section{Data and Parameters}
\label{sec:data_and_parameters}

The model is described by a large number of parameters that govern the number of
contacts a person has, the likelihood of becoming infected on each contact, the
likelihood of developing light or strong symptoms or even dying from the disease as well
as the duration each stage of the disease takes.

Most of these parameters can be calibrated from existing datasets or the medical
literature or calibrated from surveys and empirical datasets.

\subsection{Number of Contacts\comment[id=HM]{Histograms seem like the way to go here. Also add household contacts, i.e., distribution of (household size minus 1).}}
\label{sub:number_of_contacts}

We calibrate the parameters for the predicted numbers of contacts from contact diaries
of over 2000 individuals from Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg
\citep{Mossong2008}. Each contact diary contains all contacts an individual had
throughout one day, including information on the other person (such as age and gender)
and information on the contact. Importantly, for each contact individuals entered of
which type the contact (school, leisure, work etc.) was and how frequent the contact
with the other person is.

Simplifying the number of contacts, we arrive at the following distributions of the
numbers of contacts by contact type.\comment[id=K]{Put plots into one figure.}

An exception where we do not rely on the data by \cite{Mossong2008} are the household
contacts. Since household are included in the the German microcensus\comment[id=K]{Cite
microcensus} on which we build our synthetic population we simply assume for the
household contact model that individuals meet all other household members every day.

\subsection{Contacts by age}
\label{subsec:contacts_by_age}

As mentioned in section \ref{sec:matching}, the probability that two individuals are
matched can depend on background characteristics. In particular, we allow this
probability to depend on age and county of residence. While we do not have good data on
geographical assortativity and just roughly calibrate it such that 80\% of contacts are
within the same county, we can calibrate the assortative mixing by age from the same
data we use to calibrate the number of contacts.\comment[id=HM]{Redo

contacts or better add a similar figure showing total number of contacts by age in all
networks}

        group. A row shows the share of contacts a certain age group has with all other
        age groups. Higher values are colored in darker red tones. The diagonal
        represents the share of contacts with individuals from the same age group.}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:assortativity_other} shows that assortativity by age is especially strong
for children and younger adults. For older people, the pattern becomes more dispersed
around their own age group, but within-age-group contacts are still the most common
contacts.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9 \textwidth]{../figures/results/figures/data/assortativity_work_non_recurrent}

        only show age groups that have a significant fraction of working individuals.}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:assortativity_work} shows that assortativity by age is also important
among work contacts.

Our other two types of contacts, households and schools, get their assortativity by
construction. Schools are groups where the same children of the mostly same age group and
county meet with teachers every day. Household composition follows directly from the
German microcensus data we use to construct our synthetic population.\comment[id=HM]{So
no work in here? How about school? Can we add a column with marginals and another one
with work / (school?), too?}\comment[id=K]{I hope adding work and writing about school and
households addresses all questions. I think marginals would be confusing because they may not add up to one given that age groups have different group sizes.}\comment[id=HM]{See previous comment. My point is that total number of contacts rather than shares are much more informative in the first place, then different group sizes are no concern anymore.}

\subsection{Infection Probabilities\comment[id=HM]{Is the data section the right place?}}
\label{subsec:infection_probs}


To calibrate infection probabilities outside of the model, it would be important to know
the exact duration and distance of each contact type as well as viral loads. Since this
is not available in any data set, we estimate those parameters inside the model with the
method of simulated moments \citep{McFadden1989} by minimizing the distance between
simulated and observed infection rates. Since our model includes a lot of randomness, we
average simulated infection rates over several model runs.

We use data for Germany from October 2020 until June 2021. We do not use
earlier periods for three reasons. Firstly, in the beginning PCR tests were highly
limited and therefore it would be difficult to find good initial conditions for our
simulations. In addition during the summer the case numbers were extremely low. This
could lead to the epidemic going extinct in our simulation. Additionally, our model does
not include international travel or other imports of cases. These would be important but
difficult to model during the summer months.

To avoid over-fitting and simplify the numerical optimization problem, we only allow for
five different probabilities: 1) for contacts in schools 2) contacts in preschools and
nurseries. 3) for work contacts. 4) for households. 5) for other contacts.

The infection probabilities estimated from our model are as follows: For household
contacts (each individual meets all his or her household members every day) the infection
probability is 10\%, for school contacts (all students and teachers meet all other
students and teachers that attend school that day and there are three classes taking
place each day) the probability of infection is 1.2\%, for preschools and nurseries that
infection probability is 0.5\%. Work contacts carry a risk of 14.5\% and other activities
(including leisure activities such as meeting friends) carry the highest risk with
15.875\%.\comment[id=HM]{Are these numbers current? In any case, a table would substitute for this and the previous paragraph. Need to mention B.1.1.7 alongside.}

\subsection{Policies and Seasonality}
\label{subsec:policies_seasonality}

\FloatBarrier

In our empirical application we distinguish four groups of contact types: households,
education, work and other contacts.
% households
For households we assume that the individuals'
contacts in their households do not change over our estimation period.
% educ models
For nurseries, preschools and schools we implement vacations as announced by the German
federal states as well as school closures, emergency care and A / B schooling where only
one half of students attends every other week or day. For the moment we ignore that lack
of childcare leads working parents to stay home. An approximation of the share of contacts still taking place with the different school regulations can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:school_multiplier}.

% work models
For our work models\footnote{We distinguish non-recurrent work contacts, daily work
    contacts and weekly work contacts.} we use the reductions in work mobility reported in
the Google Mobility Data \citep{Google2021} to calibrate our work policies. Reductions in
work contacts are not random but governed through a work contact priority where the
policy changes the threshold below which workers stay home. Figure
\ref{fig:work_multiplier} shows the share of workers that go to work in our model over
time.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/results/figures/data/work_multiplier_since_sep}
    \caption{Share of Workers with Work Contacts}
    \label{fig:work_multiplier}
    \floatfoot{\noindent The figure shows the work mobility as reported by \cite{Google2021}. We
        take this as a proxy of the share of workers who are not in home office, i.e. who
        still have physical work contacts. The figure interpolates over weekends as we
        handle weekend effects through information on work on weekends in the German
        census data we use. The figure shows the share aggregated over Germany as a
        whole. To capture the effect that local policies, school vacations and public
        policies have on work contacts we use the data by German state to determine which
        workers go to work depending on the state they live in.}
\end{figure}

For both work and school contacts we assume that starting November with the lockdown
light in Germany, hygiene measures (such as masks, ventilation and hand washing) became
more strict and more conscientiously observed, leading to a reduction of 33\% in the number of contacts with the potential to transmit Covid-19.

% other contacts
For the last group of contacts which cover things like leisure activities, grocery
shopping etc. we have no reliable data by how much policies reduce them. In addition,
they are likely to be affected by social and psychological factors such as pandemic
fatigue and vacations. Because of this we estimate them like the infection probabilities
to fit the time series data. We use very few change points and tie them to particular
events such as policy announcements or particular holidays. Because of the scarce data situation we cannot distinguish between a hygiene factor (such as mask wearing) during meetings and physical distancing (such as virtual meetings with friends).

    \label{fig:other_multiplier}
    \floatfoot{\noindent}
\end{figure}

% seasonality
Another potentially important factor for a contact to lead to an infection is the
seasonality \citep{Kuehn2020, Carlson2020} There are two channels through which
seasonality affects the infectiousness of contacts. One has to do with the physical
conditions like the temperature and the humidity. The other has to do with where people
meet. Especially leisure contacts are more likely to take place outdoors and individuals
are more likely to have windows open when the weather is nicer. To capture both channels
we allow for other contacts to have a higher seasonality than our other contact models.
Figure~\ref{fig:seasonality} shows our seasonality factors.

        rapid tests are slightly conservative. The overall share is below that in the
