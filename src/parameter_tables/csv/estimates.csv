\textbf{Infection Probabilities},,
$\beta_{household}$,0.1,base probability of getting infected by an infectious household member
$\beta_{school}$,0.012,base probability of getting infected by an infectious classmate or teacher
$\beta_{young\:educ}$,0.005,base probability of getting infected by an infectious classmate or teacher
$\beta_{work}$,0.1475,base infection probability for work contacts
$\beta_{other}$,0.15875,base infection probability for other contacts
\textbf{Policy Parameters},,
$\rho_{hygiene}$,0.66,reduces infectiousness of work and education contacts from November to end of simulation
"$\rho_{other,\:before\:Oct\:1}$",0.75, before October
"$\rho_{other,\:Oct\:1\:to\:Oct\:20}$",1.00, high activity due to reopenings and fall vacations
"$\rho_{other,\:Oct\:21\:to\:Nov\:1}$",0.75,anticipation of a lockdown and precaution due to high incidenes
"$\rho_{other,\:Nov\:2\:to\:Dec\:1}$",0.52,``lockdown light''
"$\rho_{other,\:Dec\:2\:to\:Dec\:23}$",0.57,``lockdown light'' with lockdown fatigue and holiday shopping
"$\rho_{other,\:Dec\:24\:to\:Dec\:26}$",0.65,Christmas holidays
"$\rho_{other,\:Dec\:27\:to\:Feb\:10}$",0.35,hard lockdown after Christmas
"$\rho_{other,\:Feb\:11\:to\:Feb\:28}$",0.50,lower precaution due to low incidences and lockdown fatigue
"$\rho_{other,\:after\:Feb\:28}$",0.515,many contact reducing policies are lifted
\textbf{B.1.1.7 Introduction},,
"$\omega_{B.1.1.7,\:Jan\:31}$",0.986,number of B.1.1.7 cases per 100 000 individuals to import on January 31st. Imported B.1.1.7 cases gradually rise from January 1st where 0 cases are imported. No cases are imported in other months.
\textbf{Rapid Test Introduction},,
"$\pi_{private, t}$",Figure \ref{fig:rapid_test_demand},the private rapid tests levels in mid March and at Easter as well as the date at which full availability of private rapid tests is reached are fit to the data. Values between those levels are interpolated linearly. The remaining rapid tests demands are calibrated from surveys. See Section~\ref{subsec:rapid_test_demand}
