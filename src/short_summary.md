# 1-2 sentences basic introduction to the field 
The CoViD-19 pandemic has raised many urgent scientific questions and continues
to pose an important challenge to humanity. 

# 2-3 sentences more detailed background
While vaccines hold the promise of containment in the medium term¹ it is of
utmost importance to employ an effective mix of strategies to contain the virus
until herd immunity is reached globally.

At the moment countries rely on diverse sets of containment measures, including
vaccinations, rapid testing, and nuanced non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs). 

# 1 sentence stating the problem 
Despite their high social costs, the effects of these policies nor the influence
of seasonal patterns or virus strains are well understood in quantitative terms.

# 1 sentence main result 
Here we show that rapid tests and seasonality are responsible for over 80% of
the decline in an environment with high vaccination rates, using an
agent-based simulation model that incorporates all of these factors
simultaneously.

# 2-3 sentences explaining how the main result adds to previous knowledge
So far, efforts to quantify the effects of different policies have mostly relied
on natural experiments and extensions of the SIR model.²³ 

Agent-based models have also been used to predict the effects of policies but
the applications have been small in scope with respect to the population, the
time period covered and the policies under consideration.⁴⁵⁶

We are the first to quantify the effects of different policies and able to do so
with a detailed model that can match two epidemic waves with a variety of active
policies, seasonal variation and new virus strains.

# 1-2 sentences: put results into a more general context 
These results demonstrate that frequent, large-scale rapid testing should be a
prominent strategy to contain CoViD-19; it can substitute for many NPIs that
come at a much larger cost to individuals and society.
