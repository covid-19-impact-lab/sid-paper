# 1-2 sentences basic introduction to the field 
In order to slow the spread of the CoViD-19 pandemic, governments around the
world have enacted a wide set of policies aimed at limiting transmissions.

# 2-3 sentences more detailed background
While vaccines hold the promise of containment in the medium term - at least for
developed countries - it is of utmost importance to employ an effective mix of
strategies to contain the virus until herd immunity is reached globally.

At the moment countries rely on diverse sets of containment measures, including
vaccinations, rapid testing, and nuanced non-pharmaceutical interventions
(NPIs). 

# 1 sentence stating the problem 
Despite their high economic and social costs, the effects of these policies nor
the influence of seasonal patterns or virus strains are well understood in
quantitative terms.

# 1 sentence main result 
Here we show that rapid tests and seasonality are responsible for over 80% of
the decline in case numbers Germany experienced in spring 2021 using an
agent-based simulation model that incorporates all of these factors
simultaneously.

# 2-3 sentences explaining how the main result adds to previous knowledge
Our agent-based simulation model goes far beyond previous agent-based models. 

It introduces a novel and detailed model of case detection and rapid test
demand, is estimated on long time series case data and models policies such as
vaccinations, work from home mandates and schooling provisions in great detail.

# 1-2 sentences: put results into a more general context 
Switching different policies off, our simulations show that during a period
where vaccination rates rose from 5% to 40%, seasonality and rapid testing had
the largest effect on reducing infection numbers. 

# 2-3 sentences: broader perspective (optional)
These results demonstrate that frequent, large-scale rapid testing should be a
prominent strategy to contain CoViD-19; it can substitute for many NPIs that
come at a much larger cost to individuals and society.
