infection\_prob,$\beta_{c}$,always,estimated,"Unadjusted infection probability of contact type `c`. Since the infection probability also depends on the seasonality, susceptibility of the contact and the virus strain these should not be interpreted directly. The ratio of the infection probabilities gives how risky a contact of one type (e.g. work) is compared to another (e.g. school) per contact with transmission potential."
susceptibility,$\zeta_{a}$,always,\cite{Davies2020},Susceptibility to Covid-19 depends on a personâ€™s age group. The higher the age the more easily people become infected.
seasonality,"$\kappa_{c, t}$",always,\cite{Kuehn2020} and \cite{Gavenciak2021},The probability to contract Covid-19 when exposed depends on the seasonality. Since different contact types are more or less subject to seasonal variation (e.g. by moving contacts outdoors) the seasonality also depends on the contact type.
variant\_infectiousness,$\sigma_{v}$,always,\cite{Davies2021},Variant $v$'s contagiousness relative to the wild type.
